## Swiss AI Weeks
This repository was created during the [SwissAIWeeks](https://swiss-ai-weeks.ch/) in Lausanne. It was developed from myself sololy, reaching the first price among 70 partecipants divided in teams of 4-5 people!

## Functionalities:
1. **Insert a location**: You can either use the text box of simply by clicking a location in the map.
2. **Feed information**: Tell the app about yourself! How long have you been climbing for? How old are you? How much sport do you do? And most importantly, how difficult is the hike that you are planning to do?
3. **Let the magic happen**: The app will scan the weather forecast for tomorrow, collecting all the data and reporting the most relevant ones. Moreover, it will prepare a list of things that you most likely want to put in the backpack. Nothing will be forgot! 

Q: And if I still have questions?

A: *"Hello! I'm the Swiss Hiker, and I will be your mentor for helping you planning this amazing hike! You can find me in the app :))"*
